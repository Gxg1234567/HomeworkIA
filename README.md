Description

The Traveling Salesman Problem is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. This TSP solver implements various algorithms to find the optimal solution, including Depth-First Search (DFS), A* search, and Uniform Cost Search (UCS).

Usage

To use the TSP solver:
